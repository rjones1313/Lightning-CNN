# Lightning-CNN
Code used to create figures and analysis of A Deep Learning Model of Lightning Stroke Density by Jones II et al.

The lightning dataset used in this study, the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) is not publicly available. Please go to https://wwlln.net to request the data. Due to data availability as well as file size constraints on GitHub, the code located in this repository has been slightly modified. The file figure_generation.ipynb has been modified to account for the smaller dataset in order to make figures display data (such as the contour levels in Figure 5), but the overall framework of the script has remained the same.
